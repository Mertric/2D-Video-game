  - Green slime: jumps and glides


## Controls

* A Key: moves player's character to the left
* D Key: moves player's character to the right
* Space Bar - player's character jumps


## Process of Creating the Game

Godot was the game engine used in order to implement our game idea. This engine offered tools to create a 2D platformer video game.
The language that was used was GDScript, Godot’s internal program language. 
Our team members had to learn how GDScript worked and how to also use it with the animated objects that will be used in the game.

Assets were needed for the visual animations of the game. The assets were saved as png files and imported into Godot in order to be used. 
Types of Assets used (Credits to artists at the end of README.md):
* User's character
